# Reacher Sim
Simulation and Reinforcement Learning for Reacher Robot

## System setup
### Operating system requirements
* Mac
* Linux
* Windows

### Mac-only setup
Install xcode command line tools.
```bash
xcode-select --install
```
If you already have the tools installed you'll get an error saying so, which you can ignore.

### Windows-only setup
The PyBullet simulator requires Microsoft Visual C++ to compile on Windows. You can find the download link for the build tools [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/). Once you have that installed, run the program and select the option for "Desktop development with C++". Leave all the "optional" downloads checked and download the packages. It will be quite a large download.

### Conda setup
Now install miniconda through [this link](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). Once that's done, create a conda environment for the project by running the terminal commands below. If you're on Windows, you will need to do this in the Anaconda Prompt Terminal. Those on Linux and MacOS can run the commands in a regular terminal. 
```
conda create --name reacher python=3.8
conda activate reacher
pip install ray arspb
```

## Getting the code ready
If you followed along with the instructions in Hands-On 3, you should have already cloned this repo to your computer. Navigation to the reacher-lab folder and run the following commands to install the dependencies for the simulator.
```bash
cd RBT350-HandsOn3  
pip install -e .
```

## Running simulation on computer
```bash
python reacher/reacher_manual_control.py
```
You should see the PyBullet GUI pop up and see Reacher following the joint positions set by the sliders.

## Running with inverse kinematics
```bash
python3 reacher/reacher_manual_control.py --ik
```
Assuming you have implemented all the functions inside of `reacher_kinematics.py` according to their documentation, you can run the above command to enable Cartesian control of the robot. Be slow with the sliders as the leg has a very limited range for where it can be. You will see that sometimes the leg starts jerking because it is unable to find a suitable solution for the given XYZ coordinate.

## Deploying to robot
### Upload reacher lab firmware to Teensy
1. Open vscode and upload a stable version of your Hands-On 2 code. This is just to get the Teensy application to open in the background.

2. Click the "open hex file" button in the application window (left side) and choose the `firmware.hex` THAT'S IN THIS FOLDER (not from your Hands-On 2 code).

3. Click the green auto button if it's not already highlighted

4. Press the button on the Teensy to program it with the hex file

### Run simulator and robot simultaneously
Run the python code:
```bash
python3 reacher/reacher_manual_control.py --run_on_robot
```
to do joint control of one leg and
```bash
python3 reacher/reacher_manual_control.py --run_on_robot --ik
```
to do Cartesian control of the leg.
